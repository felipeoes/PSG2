Llama 2 is a large language model developed by Meta AI Research. It is a transformer-based
language model trained on a massive amount of data from the internet, including text from social media sites
like Facebook and Instagram. Llama 2 is designed to generate human-like text, such as text that sounds like
it was written by a person rather than a machine. It can also be used for tasks such as answering questions,
summarizing articles, and generating creative writing.

 Unlike traditional NLP models, LLMs are trained using large amounts of unlabelled text data,
which allows them to learn complex patterns and relationships between words and concepts. This makes
them highly effective at generating natural language responses, but also means they can sometimes produce
incorrect or offensive answers.

Answer: LLMs are large language models that have been trained on vast amounts of unlabelled text data. They
can generate high-quality, coherent text, but they can also produce incorrect or offensive answers.

Question: Como funciona um LLM?
Helpful Answer: LLMs work by predicting the next word in a sequence of words based on the previous words.
They do this by looking at the entire corpus of training data and learning patterns and relationships between
words and concepts. This allows them to generate natural language responses that are often very accurate,
but they can also produce incorrect or offensive
